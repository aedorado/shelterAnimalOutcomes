This repository contains my various attempts at learning various techniques and methods
to solve a ML classification problem. The problem chosen is a competition from [Kaggle][kaggle],
the [Shelter Animal Outcomes][comp]. 

The problem is to predict the probabilities of an animal getting adopted, transfered, death from 
natural causes, euthanasia, or returned to it's owner. The following features are given to us
age, breed, color, gender, spayed/neutered/intact, whether cat/dog, name etc.

The suggested reading order would be:

1. [Visualization][visualization]
2. [Data cleaning][cleaning]
3. [Random forests][rndmForest]
4. [Logistic Regression][logisticRegression]
